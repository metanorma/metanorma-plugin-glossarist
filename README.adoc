== Purpose

Glossarist is the https://github.com/glossarist/concept-model[concept model]
created and published by the https://www.glossarist.org[Glossarist Project].


== Glossarist concept model

The Glossarist model is a structured way to represent concepts and terms
in a consistent and standardized manner. It is designed to be used in
various contexts, including standards, technical documentation, and
knowledge management systems.

The model was originally developed to handle the terminology database of
the https://www.electropedia.org/[IEC 60050 International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV)]
and is a superset of the https://www.iso.org/standard/40362.html[ISO 10241-1]
concept model used in the ISO Directives.

The Glossarist model is used by the
https://isotc211.geolexica.org/[ISO/TC 211 Multilingual Glossary of Terms],
https://isotc204.geolexica.org[ISO/TC 204 Geolexica for Intelligent transport systems (ISO 14812)]
and the https://osgeo.geolexica.org[OSGeo Glossary].

This plugin allows you to access the Glossarist dataset inside a Metanorma
document, render concepts, and generate bibliographies for terms defined in the
dataset.

The https://www.iso.org/standard/81196.html[ISO 10303-2:2024] and
https://www.iso.org/standard/77019.html[ISO 34000:2023] standards were published
using this plugin.

The full concept model (a concept can have multiple localized concepts) is
available via the https://github.com/glossarist/glossarist-ruby[Glossarist] gem.

Language codes used in Glossarist are ISO 639-* 3-character codes, as described
in the https://github.com/glossarist/concept-model[Glossarist Concept model].

== Installation

This plugin is included in the default Metanorma distribution.

== Usage

=== General

This plugin is used to load a Glossarist dataset, render concepts from it,
and generate bibliographies for terms defined in the dataset.

A Glossarist dataset typically consists of one or more YAML files, where a
single file usually contains a single concept (potentially multilingual) and all
its associated data, such as definitions, examples, notes, sources, and
bibliographic references.

The general workflow for using this plugin is as follows:

. Load a Glossarist dataset globally or for a block
. Render terms from the loaded dataset
. Generate bibliographies for terms in the dataset

Steps 2 and 3 are separate steps as a Metanorma document typically contains
separate terms sections and bibliography sections, hence the plugin allows you
to render terms and bibliographies independently.

While the plugin provides commands for steps 2 and 3, it is also possible to
render such content using the Liquid templating language directly in a
Glossarist block.

There are two ways to use this plugin:

* Use a Glossarist block together with a custom template.
* Use the commands provided by the plugin to render terms and bibliographies.

=== Using a Glossarist block

This plugin provides a Glossarist block that allows you to load a Glossarist
dataset and render terms from it using a Liquid template.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
------
[glossarist,{dataset-path},{filters},{context}]
----
// Liquid template
----
------

Where,

`{dataset-path}`:: The path to the Glossarist dataset (e.g.,
`./path/to/glossarist-dataset`).

`{context}`:: The context in which the dataset is being used (e.g., `concepts`).

`{filters}`:: (Optional) Filters to apply to the dataset prior to making the
`context` available.

[example]
======
Given the following Glossarist block:

[source,adoc]
------
[glossarist,my-dataset,concepts]
----
{%- for concept in concepts -%}
==== {{ concept.data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation }}

{{ concept.data.localizations['eng'].data.definition[0].content }}
{%- endfor -%}
----

======


In the block syntax, filters can be applied to the dataset to filter or sort the
concepts based on specific criteria. For example, you can filter concepts by
group or language, or sort them by term.

Multiple filters can be applied by separating them with a semicolon `;`.

.Using multiple filters
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
------
[glossarist,dataset,filter='group=foo;sort_by=term',concepts]
----
...
----
------
====


The following types of filters are supported:

Collection filters:: These filters are applied to the entire dataset and affect
which concepts are loaded into the block.

`sort_by=<field name>`::: Sorts the dataset in ascending order of the given
field values. The field `term` is a special case, where it sorts according to
the `default_designation` of the term.
+
[example]
`sort_by=term` will sort concepts in ascending order based on the
default term (which is the first English designation, at `data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation`).

`lang=<language code>`::: Loads concepts in the specified language.
+
[example]
`lang=ara` loads all localized concepts of Arabic for all concepts.

`group=<group name>`::: Loads concepts that belong to the specified group. Group is a dataset-specific
field that can be used to categorize concepts.
+
[example]
`group=foo` will only load concepts that have a group named `foo`.

Field filters:: These filters are applied to individual fields of the concepts
and affect which concepts are included in the block based on the values of those
fields.

`{path}=({value})`::: Value match. Loads concepts where the value of the
specified field matches the given value.
+
[example]
`data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation=entity` will only load
  concepts where the English term is "entity".

`start_with({value})`::: Value starts with. Loads concepts where the specified field starts with the given value.
+
[example]
`data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation.start_with(enti)` will only
load concepts where the English term starts with "enti".


[example]
====
[source,adoc]
--------
Given the following Glossarist block:

[source,adoc]
------
[glossarist,glossarist-v2,filter='data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation.start_with(conc)',concepts]
----
{%- for concept in concepts -%}
==== {{ concept.data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation }}

{{ concept.data.localizations['eng'].data.definition[0].content }}
{%- endfor -%}

=== Loading a Glossarist dataset globally

In cases where the document works mainly with a single Glossarist dataset, it is
possible to load the dataset globally at the beginning of the document for
performance reasons. This allows you to use the dataset in any block without
having to specify the dataset path again.

Glossarist provides the `:glossarist-dataset:` syntax in the document attributes
section to load a dataset globally. Each dataset will henceforth be identified
by the unique name and path.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
// header
:glossarist-dataset: {dataset1-name}:{dataset1-path};{dataset2-name}:{dataset2-path}

// content
----

Where,

`{dataset-name}`:: The name of the dataset (e.g., `dataset`).

`{dataset-path}`:: The path to the Glossarist dataset (e.g., `./path/to/glossarist-dataset`).

One or more datasets can be loaded by separating them with a semicolon `;`.

These datasets can then be used in any Glossarist block in the document
without having to specify the dataset path again.

[example]
====
[source,adoc]
------
:glossarist-dataset: dataset1:./path/to/glossarist-dataset1;dataset2:./path/to/glossarist-dataset2

=== Terms and definitions
[glossarist,dataset1,concepts]
----
{%- for concept in concepts -%}
Term: {{ concept.data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation }}

{%- endfor -%}
----
------

The output will be:

[source,adoc]
----
=== Terms and definitions
Term: concept

Term: address component
----
====


=== Glossarist predefined templates

==== General

Glossarist provides predefined templates for rendering concepts and
bibliographies.

==== Rendering one concept

The `glossarist::render[{dataset-name},{term}]` command renders a single concept
from the globally loaded dataset.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
glossarist::render[{dataset-name}, {term}]
----

Where,

`{dataset-name}`:: The name of the dataset (e.g., `dataset`).

`{term}`:: The term to render (e.g., `foobar`).
+
NOTE: The `term` points to the
`data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation` field of the concept.

[example]
====
Given the following code:

[source,adoc]
----
:glossarist-dataset: dataset:my-dataset

=== Terms and definitions

glossarist::render[dataset,concept]
----

The output will be:

[source,adoc]
----
=== Terms and definitions

==== concept

unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics

[NOTE]
Concepts are not necessarily bound to particular languages.  They are, however,
influenced by the social or cultural background which often leads to different
categorizations.

[.source]
<<ISO_1087-1_2000,3.2.1>>
----
====

The command automatically detects section depth (e.g., `=== Terms and
definitions` is at depth 2) and renders the concept at "depth + 1". It uses the
default template for rendering a single concept, which is defined in the plugin.

The default template for rendering a single concept is used, and is provided at
<<default-template-for-rendering-concepts>>.

==== Rendering all concepts

The `glossarist::import[{dataset-name}]` command renders all concepts from the
globally loaded dataset.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
glossarist::import[{dataset-name}]
----

Where,

`{dataset-name}`:: The name of the dataset (e.g., `dataset`).

[example]
======
Given the following code:

[source,adoc]
----
:glossarist-dataset: dataset:my-dataset

=== Terms and definitions

glossarist::import[dataset]
----

The output will be:

[source,adoc]
----
=== Terms and definitions

==== concept

unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics

[NOTE]
====
Concepts are not necessarily bound to particular languages.  They are, however,
influenced by the social or cultural background which often leads to different
categorizations.
====

[.source]
<<ISO_1087-1_2000,3.2.1>>

==== address component

constituent part of the address

[NOTE]
====
An address component may reference another object such as a spatial object
(e.g. an administrative boundary or a land parcel) or a non-spatial object (e.g.
an organization or a person).
====

[NOTE]
====
An address component may have one or more alternative values, e.g. alternatives
for "street" could include "road", "avenue", or "boulevard".
====

[.source]
<<ISO_19160-1_2015,4.5>>
----
======


==== Bibliography for a single term

The `glossarist::render_bibliography_entry[{dataset-name}, {term}]` command renders
a bibliography entry for a single term in the globally loaded dataset.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
glossarist::render_bibliography_entry[{dataset-name}, {term}]
----

Where,

`{dataset-name}`:: The name of the dataset (e.g., `dataset`).

`{term}`:: The term to render the bibliography for (e.g., `foo`).

The command automatically detects the bibliographic reference for the term and
renders it using the default template for bibliography, which is defined in
<<default-template-for-bibliography>>.

[example]
====
Given the following code:

[source,adoc]
----
:glossarist-dataset: dataset:my-dataset

...

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

glossarist::render_bibliography_entry[dataset, foo]
----

The output will be:

[source,adoc]
----
== Bibliography

* [[[ISO_1087-1_2000,ISO 1087-1:2000]]]
----
====

==== Bibliography for all terms

The `glossarist::render_bibliography[{dataset-name}]` command renders a
bibliography for all terms in the globally loaded dataset.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
glossarist::render_bibliography[{dataset-name}]
----

Where,

`{dataset-name}`:: The name of the dataset (e.g., `dataset`).

[example]
====
Given the following code:

[source,adoc]
----
:glossarist-dataset: dataset:my-dataset

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

glossarist::render_bibliography[dataset]
----

The output will be:

[source,adoc]
----
== Bibliography

* [[[ISO_1087-1_2000,ISO 1087-1:2000]]]
* [[[ISO_19160-1_2015,ISO 19160-1:2015]]]
----
====


== Extended examples

This section provides extended examples of using the Glossarist plugin with realistic sample data.

[example]
.Basic rendering of all terms
====
Suppose we have the following terms in our dataset:

|===
| Name | Definition | Groups

| concept
| Unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics
| terminology

| address component
| Constituent part of the address
| addressing, location

| spatial reference system
| System for identifying position in the real world
| geospatial, coordinate
|===

Using the following Glossarist block:

[source,asciidoc]
------
=== Terms and definitions
[glossarist, /path/to/glossarist-dataset, dataset]
----
{%- for concept in dataset -%}
==== {{ concept.data.localizations['eng'].data.terms[0].designation }}

{{ concept.data.localizations['eng'].data.definition[0].content }}
{%- endfor -%}
----
------

The output will be:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== Terms and definitions

==== concept

Unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics

==== address component
